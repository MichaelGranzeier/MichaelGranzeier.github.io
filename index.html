            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>I have been interested in the wonders of technology from a young age. It was no surprise that I would end up a student at We Code It to pursue my career in something I love most.
                From sauntering to coding, I began my informal "training" from my teenage years. After serving in the US Army, I used the resources afforded to me and the skills and connections I acquired to finally pursue formal learning for my pathway into the fascinating career of software development.</P>
            <P>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh PA, being one of nine children I learned early on the foundation duty, respect, responsibility, and obligation. These character traits have formed the kind of student and worker I am today. I value learning and feel it is the purpose of life. That is what I love about the field so much, the ability to expand beyond precocious ideas and limits.</P>
            <p>I hope to work in an environment where i am part of a team, forever learning, growing, and teaching as we complete our common goal.</p>
